### User Trips by Gender by Weekday

* This chart shows the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week; for subscribers, ridership is higher during the weekdays, but for customers it is higher during the weekends, suggesting that most one-time customers are tourists

### Top Starting Locations

### Top Ending Locations

* This chart shows the busiest ending locations; it appears that Manhattan is the busiest, likely because it's a tourist destination and has heavy traffic congestion.

## Summary

### Overview of Analysis
Overall, the majority of bike rentals are taken by males, those with subscriptions, and during commuter hours during the weekdays, with the majority of rentals being made in Manhattan.

### Further Analysis
Further analysis can be done on the usage habits of tourists, by plotting a count of trip duration with different usertypes. Additionally, analysis can be done on the ages of tourists that like bikesharing by plotting a count of birth years with different usertypes.
